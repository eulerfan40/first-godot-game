# First Godot Game  

Godot offers a [web editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/), or you can [download it](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) and follow along.

## Progress

- **2/21 Meeting:** Up till **23:30** in the video curriculum below, plus some animations. Added Player with follow camera and WASD + arrow key movement. Added all animations, although only idle is implemented. Created a tileset and set up a basic world tilemap.
- **2/28 Meeting:** Up till **50:06**, minus implementing the background. Added functionality for moving or stationary platforms, which have one-directional collision. Added animated coins which disappear upon pickup. Added functionality for killzones which reload the scene after a short timer, to be used for enemies, spikes, etc. Implemented the killzone in a bottom bound, which also stops the camera from falling endlessly. Added all three enemy animations, although only idle is implemented, and the enemy movement system, which changes the direction of the enemy every time it hits a wall.
